# NFT Profile Display Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed:

### 1. **Database Query Issues**
- **Problem**: Foreign key references using specific constraint names that might not exist
- **Fix**: Changed from `profiles!nfts_creator_id_fkey(id, name, avatar_url)` to `profiles(id, name, avatar_url)`

### 2. **Missing Error Handling**
- **Problem**: No error handling for database queries
- **Fix**: Added error handling and logging for all major queries

### 3. **Likes Field Issues**
- **Problem**: Queries were trying to select a `likes` field that doesn't exist in the NFT table
- **Fix**: 
  - Removed `likes` from direct NFT queries
  - Added separate query to count likes from the `likes` table
  - Updated data transformation to handle missing likes

### 4. **Status Filter Issues**
- **Problem**: Status filters might not match actual database values
- **Fix**: 
  - For created NFTs: Include all statuses (`draft`, `active`, `available`, `sold`)
  - For owned NFTs: Exclude draft status only

### 5. **Data Transformation Issues**
- **Problem**: Array handling for creator data and missing null checks
- **Fix**: Added null checks and proper array handling for creator information

## Files Modified:

### `/app/profile/[user]/page.tsx`
- Added comprehensive error handling
- Fixed foreign key references
- Improved status filtering
- Added likes count functionality
- Added debug logging

### New Debug Tools Created:

1. **`/app/debug-profile/page.tsx`** - A debug page to test profile data fetching
2. **`debug-profile.js`** - Command line debug script
3. **`create-test-data.js`** - Script to create test NFTs for testing

## Testing Steps:

1. **Start the application**: The Next.js app should already be running
2. **Visit debug page**: Go to `http://localhost:3000/debug-profile` 
3. **Create test data**: Run `node create-test-data.js` to create sample NFTs
4. **Test profile**: Visit a user profile page to see if NFTs display correctly

## Potential Remaining Issues:

1. **Database Connection**: Supabase might not be running or configured properly
2. **Authentication**: User might not be authenticated when viewing profiles
3. **RLS Policies**: Row Level Security policies might still be blocking access
4. **Migration Issues**: Database schema might not be fully migrated

## Next Steps for Testing:

1. Ensure Supabase is running locally
2. Create test user accounts through the app's auth system
3. Use the debug tools to identify any remaining issues
4. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
5. Verify database has the correct schema and data

## Key Changes Made:

```typescript
// Before (problematic):
creator:profiles!nfts_creator_id_fkey(id, name, avatar_url)

// After (fixed):
creator:profiles(id, name, avatar_url)
```

```typescript
// Before (missing likes):
select('id, title, media_url, price, status, sale_type, likes, views')

// After (proper likes handling):
select('id, title, media_url, price, status, sale_type, views')
// + separate likes count query
```

The main issue was likely the foreign key reference syntax and missing error handling that would have made debugging difficult.
