feat(chat): Switch from realtime to polling for better reliability

**Changes:**
- Remove Supabase realtime subscriptions from chat system
- Always use polling mode with 2-second intervals for message updates  
- Simplify state management by removing realtime-related variables
- Update UI to show consistent "Polling Mode" status
- Optimize polling queries to only fetch new messages since last update
- Improve duplicate message prevention with Set-based ID checking

**Benefits:**
✅ More reliable message delivery across all network conditions
✅ Simpler codebase without realtime subscription complexity  
✅ Better cross-platform compatibility
✅ Reduced dependency on Supabase realtime configuration
✅ Predictable performance and resource usage
✅ Easier testing and debugging

**Performance:**
- 2-second polling interval for optimal balance of responsiveness and efficiency
- Efficient queries using timestamps to fetch only new messages
- Proper cleanup of polling intervals on component unmount

**User Impact:**
- Messages now arrive reliably within 1-2 seconds
- No more "switching to polling mode" warnings
- Consistent chat experience for all users
- Better performance on mobile and poor network connections

Breaking Changes: None - chat functionality remains the same for end users
