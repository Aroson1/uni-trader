# Chat Database Setup Instructions

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: You MUST run this SQL in your Supabase Dashboard

The chat system won't work until you create the database tables.

## Steps:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**

   - Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
   - Click "New Query"

2. **Copy and Paste the SQL**

   - Open the file: `supabase/migrations/20250122010000_clean_chat_schema.sql`
   - Copy ALL the content (305 lines)
   - Paste into the SQL Editor

3. **Run the SQL**

   - Click the "Run" button (or press Ctrl+Enter)
   - Wait for the success message

4. **Verify Tables Were Created**
   - Go to "Table Editor" in the left sidebar
   - You should see these new tables:
     - conversations
     - conversation_participants
     - messages
     - message_reads
     - typing_indicators
     - message_reactions

## What This Does:

✅ Creates all chat tables with proper relationships
✅ Sets up Row Level Security (RLS) policies
✅ Creates performance indexes
✅ Adds helper functions for queries
✅ Sets up automatic triggers

## After Running:

1. Refresh your application
2. Try clicking "Chat with Seller" again
3. The conversation should now be created successfully

## Troubleshooting:

**If you get an error about existing tables:**

- The SQL includes `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` statements
- It will safely remove old tables and create new ones

**If you get permission errors:**

- Make sure you're logged into the correct Supabase project
- You need admin/owner access to run migrations

**Still having issues?**

- Check the Supabase logs in the dashboard
- Look for any error messages in the SQL Editor
- Make sure your project is not paused
