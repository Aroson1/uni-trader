# QR Verification System Implementation

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. **Database Schema Updates**
- Added `qr_code`, `verification_code`, and `verified_at` columns to orders table
- Created `verify_order_payment()` function for secure payment completion
- Added `create_order_with_verification()` function for order creation with verification codes
- Updated order status to include `awaiting_verification` state

### 2. **QR Code Generation System** (`/qr/generate`)
- Displays seller's orders that are awaiting verification
- Generates QR codes with verification codes for buyers to scan
- Shows order details including buyer info and NFT information
- Simple URL format: `/verify?code={verification_code}&order={order_id}`

### 3. **Payment Verification System** (`/verify`)
- Validates QR codes and verification codes
- Displays order details and verification status
- Allows buyers to complete payment to sellers
- Uses secure database function to transfer funds and mark orders complete

### 4. **Updated Purchase Flow**
1. Buyer purchases NFT ‚Üí Funds deducted immediately from buyer's wallet
2. Order created with `awaiting_verification` status and unique verification code
3. Seller generates QR code from `/qr/generate` page
4. Buyer scans QR code and visits `/verify` page
5. Buyer clicks "Complete Payment to Seller" button
6. `verify_order_payment()` function transfers funds to seller and marks order complete

- **Enhanced order management** with verification status and QR generation links

### 6. **Explore Page Updates** üÜï
- **Automatically filters out sold NFTs** (only shows `status = 'available'`)
- **Clean marketplace view** without cluttering from completed sales

## ‚úÖ All Features Complete!

### Next Steps: Database Function Fix
The only remaining task is to fix the PostgreSQL function error by running the SQL from `DATABASE_FIX_REQUIRED.md` in your Supabase SQL Editor.

Once the database functions are fixed, the entire system will be fully functional!

## üìä Technical Implementation Details

### Database Functions Used:
```sql
-- Completes NFT purchase and creates verification order
complete_nft_transaction(p_nft_id, p_buyer_id, p_amount)

-- Creates order with unique verification code
create_order_with_verification(p_nft_id, p_buyer_id, p_seller_id, p_price)

-- Verifies order and completes payment to seller
verify_order_payment(p_verification_code)
```

### QR Code Format:
```
URL: /verify?code={verification_code}&order={order_id}
```

### Order Status Flow:
1. `awaiting_verification` ‚Üí Order created, buyer funds deducted
2. `completed` ‚Üí Seller payment completed via verification system
3. `cancelled` ‚Üí Order cancelled (if needed)
