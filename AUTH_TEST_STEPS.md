# Authentication Test Steps

## Current Status
Your authentication is working! The debug shows:
- ✅ User authenticated: `85b0fb26-ab1f-49fa-b63a-736cb1ca5f5a`
- ✅ Profile loaded: "Awesome Alex"
- ❌ Cookie issue: "No cookies" in browser

## Test Protected Routes

1. **Navigate to test page:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3001/test-protected
   ```

2. **Try these protected routes:**
   - `/wallet` - Should work if auth is proper
   - `/profile/test` - Should work if auth is proper  
   - `/orders` - Should work if auth is proper
   - `/create` - Should work if auth is proper

3. **Check browser console for middleware logs:**
   Look for messages starting with "Middleware:"

## Cookie Issue Fix

The "No cookies" issue might be because:
1. **Development server on different port** (3001 instead of 3000)
2. **Cookie domain mismatch**
3. **SameSite cookie policy**

### Quick Fix Test:
1. **Check if it works in incognito/private window**
2. **Clear all cookies for localhost**
3. **Try logging out and back in**

## If Protected Routes Still Don't Work

Run this in browser console on any page:
```javascript
// Check cookies
console.log('All cookies:', document.cookie);

// Check localStorage for Supabase session
console.log('Supabase session:', localStorage.getItem('sb-' + 'your-project-ref' + '-auth-token'));

// Check if user is authenticated
import { supabase } from './lib/supabase';
supabase.auth.getSession().then(console.log);
```

## Expected Behavior

If auth is working correctly:
- ✅ `/test-protected` should show success message
- ✅ `/wallet`, `/profile/test`, `/orders` should load (even if they show "not found")
- ❌ You should NOT be redirected to `/auth/login`

If you're still getting redirected to login, the issue is server-side cookie reading in middleware.
