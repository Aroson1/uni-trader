## The Issue

Error: `Could not find the 'last_message_at' column of 'conversations'`

## The Fix (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Fix Database Schema

Go to **Supabase Dashboard â†’ SQL Editor** and run:

```sql
-- Copy from: supabase/migrations/20250123010000_fix_conversations_schema.sql
```

### Step 2: Enable Real-Time

In the same SQL Editor, run:

```sql
-- Copy from: supabase/migrations/20250123000000_enable_realtime_final.sql
```

## Done! âœ…

Your chat will now:

- âœ… Create conversations without errors
- âœ… Send messages in real-time

- âœ… "Chat with Seller" button works perfectly

3. Click "Chat with Seller" on an NFT
4. Send messages - they appear instantly! ðŸŽ‰

**Note:** The V1 chat was already perfect. We just needed to fix the database schema and enable real-time. That's it!
